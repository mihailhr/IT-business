A simple static website created for learning and demonstrative purposes. Prepared for 1920X1080 resolution.
Please note that this website has been developed using only HTML and CSS, without any CSS frameworks or libraries, which means it does not incorporate responsive design principles due to time constraints. Responsive websites will be featured in my later projects.
